# SimeVR Server

The Server for SlimeVR. This is a rust implementation of the mainline Java-based
[SlimeVR Server](https://github.com/SlimeVR/SlimeVR-Server/). However, we have taken
care to separate the server/networking code from the actual skeletal model.

## Implementation Status
Doesn't exist yet! ðŸ‘€

## Goals
Short term goals:
* Implement basic FK

Long term goals:
* Provide a platform to experiment with new skeletal models
* Mix slime trackers and vive trackers
* Provide java bindings to the skeletal model so that it can be used in the mainline
  Java implementation
