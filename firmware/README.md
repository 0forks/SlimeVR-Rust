# Ferrous SimeVR Firmware

The firmware for a SlimeVR Tracker. Should target the ESP32 platform. ESP8266 is not
a current platform we are targetting due to the rust ecosystem's focus on the ESP32 and
specifically the ESP32-C3.

However, we will try to write the firmware as cross-platform as possible, using
[embedded-hal](https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal) whenever possible. The
networking will be harder to be cross-platform, but we can cross that bridge when we
get there.
