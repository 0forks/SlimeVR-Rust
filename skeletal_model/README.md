# Ferrous SimeVR Skeletal Model

The skeletal model for SlimeVR. Its worth reading the documentation [here][docs],
lots of time has been spent to make it easy to understand.

## Goals
* Should be independent of networking/server.
* Easily embeddable in other applications.
* Support bindings to Java and TypeScript.
* Extensive documentation, easily understood by rust beginners.

## Implementation Status
The basic graph structure is completed, and documented. The model solver is not
yet written.
